Guerrilla-Nieuwe Linde

## Remaking a crappy website in a day

This is a remake of the site to "Nieuwe Linde".

Nieuwe Linde is a cafe in the south of Antwerp.

One of my **favorites**.

I worked on it May 10th 2019, a full day in the Becode offices in _Antwerp_.

This work was done during my junior web developer course at Becode.org.

What is  it:

  It is a very basic site. It is build with HTML and CSS. 

  No layout grid, just constructed with divs that i styled with CSS

  This was an excercise we were assigned in class.
